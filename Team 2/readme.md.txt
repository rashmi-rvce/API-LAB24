Project Overview
This project consists of a Python API script (myapi.py) and accompanying data in spreadsheet format (CSV and Excel files). The data contains shlokas (verses) from the Bhagavad Gita with translations, explanations, and additional multimedia resources. Below are the details and usage instructions.
Files Included
1.	myapi.py: A Python script for processing and potentially exposing an API for the Bhagavad Gita shloka dataset.
2.	Shlokas - Sheet1.csv: A CSV file containing the following fields:
o	Chapter Number
o	Chapter Name
o	Total Verses
o	Verse Number
o	Sanskrit (original text)
o	English Translation
o	Explanation
o	YouTube Links (related video content)
o	Image URLs (visual representations of the shlokas)
3.	Shlokas.xlsx: An Excel version of the Shlokas.csv file containing the same data.

Python Script Overview
myapi.py is designed to:
•	Load and process shloka data from the CSV or Excel files.
•	Potentially expose an API to retrieve shloka details by chapter, verse, or other criteria.
Usage:
•	Run the Python script to load the shloka data.
•	Implement or expand the script to serve the data via an API (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI).
Shloka Data
The shloka dataset provides valuable insights into each verse from the Bhagavad Gita. It includes:
•	Original Sanskrit text for each verse.
•	English translations for ease of understanding.
•	Detailed explanations of each verse.
•	Multimedia support, with links to related YouTube videos and images for further exploration.
Installation
1.	Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2.	Install the required dependencies (if any).
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3.	Place the Shlokas - Sheet1.csv or Shlokas.xlsx file in the same directory as the myapi.py script.
4.	Run the script to load and process the data.
